# Mark Walhimer — artist site

**[mark-walhimer.com](https://mark-walhimer.com)** · GitHub Pages · repo: **[walhimer-studio/walhimer.github.io](https://github.com/walhimer-studio/walhimer.github.io)**

## Structure

Two tiers on the site, plus a JSON manifest and optional narrative archive pages.

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `installations/` | Promoted work — pieces linked from the homepage |
| `sketches/` | Full archive — HTML sketches by series, plus optional folders like `tezos-early-works/` (chronicle + images) |
| `sketches/index.html` | **Catalog UI** — series list, search, filters (**single source of truth** for sketch filenames; URL path remains `/sketches/`) |
| `catalog-db.html` | **Collection DB viewer** — lightweight browser tool for `data/catalog.json` (search/filter/sort + Installation/Sketch/Linked Art links). |
| `mangle/` | **Mangle** — Tone.js sample player (Start / Pause / Stop / Record + local folder audition). Vendored `Tone.js` in `mangle/vendor/`. Live: **[mark-walhimer.com/mangle/](https://mark-walhimer.com/mangle/)** |
| `data/catalog.json` | **Single manifest** — canonical **`works[]`** only. Refresh merges **`SERIES`** from `sketches/index.html` and **`installations/*.html`** (plus existing **`works[]`** metadata). Soundscape works are rows in **`works`** (no separate section). See **[docs/unified-catalog.md](docs/unified-catalog.md)**. |
| `docs/unified-catalog.md` | Full workflow, recovery notes, DC fields. |
| `docs/archive-chronicle.md` | How the sketch index and narrative archives relate to the manifest. |

## Workflow

### Add a new sketch

1. Add self-contained HTML under `sketches/`.
2. Register it in **`sketches/index.html`** → **`SERIES`** array (correct series and file row).
3. Refresh the catalog: `python3 _scripts/refresh_catalog.py` (or `python3 _scripts/sync_artworks_json.py`), then commit **`data/catalog.json`** and push.
4. Push the repo.

### Promote a sketch to installation

1. Copy or place the file under `installations/` as needed.
2. Add cards in `index.html` and `installations/index.html`.
3. Run **`python3 _scripts/refresh_catalog.py`** so **`works[]`** and artifacts stay in sync (new HTML is picked up automatically; refine titles, dates, and **`site.tech`** in **`works[]`** if needed).
4. Push.

### Narrative archive (e.g. Tezos / Objkt phase)

1. Add a folder under `sketches/` (e.g. `sketches/your-series/index.html` + `assets/`).
2. Add one entry to **`SERIES`** in `sketches/index.html` so it appears in search and the archive list.
3. Run **`refresh_catalog.py`** (or **`sync_artworks_json.py`**), commit **`data/catalog.json`**, push.

### Push

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/walhimer.github.io
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Description of change"
git push origin main
```

### Collection DB workflow

1. Keep `data/catalog.json` current via `python3 _scripts/refresh_catalog.py`.
2. Open `catalog-db.html` to browse/search/filter the collection as a mini database.
3. If links or labels need adjustment, update `catalog-db.html` only (no manifest schema change required).

## Self-contained rule

Published files should work offline — no required external CDNs or network for core behavior. Test with Wi‑Fi off when in doubt.

---

## Walhimer Studio (organization)

Studio protocols, tools, and related repos live under **[github.com/walhimer-studio](https://github.com/walhimer-studio)**. The org profile README summarizes the archive and links to **`docs/unified-catalog.md`** and **`docs/archive-chronicle.md`**.

---

## Checklist (maintainers)

1. After changing **`SERIES`** in `sketches/index.html` or adding HTML under **`installations/`**, run **`python3 _scripts/refresh_catalog.py`** and commit **`data/catalog.json`**.
2. Verify sitemap/robots remain current for indexing (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `page-sitemap.xml`).
3. Push **`walhimer.github.io`** so GitHub Pages and the public site stay in sync.
4. If you edit the org profile, push **`walhimer-studio/.github`** separately (another clone/repo).

Optional later: add marketplace or contract IDs under **`dublin_core.relation`** (or extra fields) so platform links are preserved in *your* manifest, not only on third-party sites.
